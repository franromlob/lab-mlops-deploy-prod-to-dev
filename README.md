# LAB | MLOps Deployment Workflow (DEV → PROD)

## What you are shipping

In this lab, you will collaborate on a small project repository that contains **all files required to run the project** (script or notebook) and share the **exact environment** needed to run it. 

Work in pairs to simulate a real ML engineering workflow:

- **Developer** writes code and proposes it through a **Pull Request**.
- **Gatekeeper** reviews, tests, and approves changes before they reach production (`main`).
- You will **switch roles later**, so both students practice each role.

## Gatekeeper (first step)

1. Create a repo on GitHub  
2. **Add a README** → this creates the `main` branch  
3. Add your partner as a **collaborator**  
4. **Do NOT write code or run `git init`**. Your job is to **own & review**, not build.

## Developer

- Clone the repo (do **NOT** run `git init`):

  ```bash
  git clone <repo-url>
  cd <repo>
  ```

* Create a branch for your work:

  ```bash
  git checkout -b branch-name
  ```

* Add your code (all files necessary for the project)
  * **Required files (minimum)**
    * `README.md`
    * your project code (script or notebook)
    <!-- * `environment.yml` -->

* Commit and push **your branch only**:

  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Add setup files"
  git push -u origin branch-name
  ```

* Open a Pull Request → from your branch into `main`

:exclamation: If you need to update the PR, commit and push to the same branch again. The PR will update automatically.

## Gatekeeper after PR

* Review the PR and merge it
* Clone the repo:

  ```bash
  git clone <repo-url>
  cd <repo>
  ```

* Pull the latest code from `main`:

  ```bash
  git pull origin main
  ```

* Run the project code and test it (if it’s a notebook, you just open it in Jupyter/VS Code and run it)

## Gatekeeper Checklist

* Does the code run?
* Are required files present?
* Was anything unnecessary committed (env folders, caches, etc.)?

If something is wrong → request changes from Developer. Then **switch roles**.
Everyone should experience **both Developer and Gatekeeper duties**.


## BONUS: Environment Sharing (with Conda!)

Previously in this lab you learned how to collaborate safely in a team using:
- branches
- pull requests
- a Gatekeeper protecting `main`

Now we take our workflow one step closer to real MLOps:
The Developer must share the **exact environment** required to run the code,
and the Gatekeeper must **rebuild that environment** before testing it.

### What Is a Virtual Environment?

When you install libraries like pandas, numpy, or TensorFlow, they stay on your computer.

Over time your computer collects different versions of packages, and projects start **breaking each other**.
A **virtual environment** is like a **separate mini-computer inside your computer**.
It only contains the libraries (and versions) that a single project needs.


### Why environments matter in MLOps

If every machine uses the same environment, then the code will run the same everywhere:

**DEV → TEST → PROD**

This is how real ML teams ensure models don’t “work on my machine only.”

So, let's upgrade our lab! 💪


## Developer’s new duty

Before writing code, the Developer should now **create a Conda virtual environment for the project**.

* In **VS Code terminal** (bash):

  ```bash
  conda create -n project-env python=3.11 -y
  conda activate project-env
  ```

* Install the libraries you need (example):

  ```bash
  conda install pandas requests -y
  ```

* Work on your code normally

* Then export your environment to share it:

  ```bash
  conda env export --from-history > environment.yml
  ```

* Commit and push `environment.yml` as part of your **Pull Request**.

  * The Gatekeeper will reproduce the environment using this file.

## Gatekeeper’s new duty

After merging the PR, before testing the code:

* Recreate the environment using the Developer’s environment file:

  ```bash
  conda env create -f environment.yml -n project-env
  ```

* Activate it:

  ```bash
  conda activate project-env
  ```

* Run the project (script or notebook).

  * If it fails, the Developer must fix the environment file and update the PR.

## Things to keep in mind

* If you already created `project-env` before, you may need to remove it or use a different name.
* Consider adding a `.gitignore` so you don’t commit unnecessary files (env folders, caches, `.ipynb_checkpoints`, `__pycache__`, etc.).  # Lab-MLOps-Fran-Marcos
